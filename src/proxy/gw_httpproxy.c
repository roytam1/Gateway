 * Three request shapes reach :8765 (CLAUDE.md):
 *
 *   GET http://host/path       plain forward proxy
 *   GET https://host/path      Gateway terminates TLS with Certainly
 *   CONNECT host:443           raw bounce, or Gateway terminates the TLS
 *                              itself when connect_mitm is on
 *
 * The client hop is always HTTP/1.0 with Connection: close, so the response
 * body is EOF-delimited and a chunked origin has to be decoded on the way
 * through. Bodies stream rather than accumulate - a 2 MiB counter enforces the
 * cap without a 2 MiB buffer, which matters on an 8 MB partition.

 * making the next burst worse.
 *
 * Established connections are not the problem, only new ones, so the cap is on
 * opening rather than on total. Holding it low also gives the pool time to
 * fill: a session that waits a moment usually finds a connection waiting for
 * it instead, and pays nothing at all.
 *
 * It defaults to one. Gateway is a single cooperative thread, so two TLS
 * handshakes running at once do not overlap -- they take turns on the same

 * paying for thirty handshakes, plus thirty more for the snapshot redirects.
 * Reusing one connection collapses that to a handful.
 *
