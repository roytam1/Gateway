/*
 * gw_tunnel.h - the generic TLS tunnel ("socat") listener.
 *
 * A local application connects in plaintext; Gateway carries the far leg,
 * optionally through a forward proxy, and optionally inside TLS:
 *
 *   local_app --plain--> :tunnel_local_port --TLS--> [proxy] --> remote:port
 *
 * The canonical use is SSH: an SSH client points at the local port, Gateway
 * opens TLS to a TLS-wrapping endpoint (stunnel and friends) -- directly or
 * via an HTTP CONNECT / SOCKS5 proxy -- and splices bytes both ways. The far
 * side unwraps TLS and hands the SSH stream onward.
 *
 * Platform independent (gw_transport.h names no operating system). The proxy
 * handshake grammar lives in src/portable/gw_fwd.c so the host tests can
 * exercise it; this file is only the state machine and the buffers.
