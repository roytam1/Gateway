/*
 * gw_transport.h - what a platform has to provide for Gateway to run on it.
 *
 * This is the interface the modules in src/proxy/ speak, and nothing in it
 * names an operating system: GWConn and GWListener are opaque, so the Open
 * Transport implementation in gw_net.c and a Winsock one can both satisfy it
 * without the 2,100 lines above either of them noticing. docs/porting.md
 * section 2 is the reasoning; this file is that section made real.
 *
 * Three conventions matter more than the signatures, because every state
 * machine above depends on them:
 *
 *   - Nothing blocks. Every call returns at once and the pump does whatever
 *     small amount of work is available this pass.
 *   - Send returning 0 means flow controlled, try the next slice. It is not
 *     an error and not a closed connection.
 *   - Recv distinguishes four cases: >0 bytes, 0 for nothing right now, -1
 *     for a broken connection, -2 for an orderly close by the peer.
 *     Collapsing 0 and -2 breaks every splice.
