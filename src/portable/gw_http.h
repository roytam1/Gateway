/*
 * gw_http.h - HTTP request/response head parsing and rewriting for Module 1.
 *
 * PORTABLE: no Mac or Windows headers. See gw_util.h.
 *
 * Gateway accepts three request shapes on :8765 (CLAUDE.md, Module 1):
 *
 *   1. GET http://host/path HTTP/1.0    classic forward proxy
 *   2. GET https://host/path HTTP/1.0   Classilla with
 *                                       network.http.proxy.use-http-proxy-for-https
 *   3. CONNECT host:443 HTTP/1.0        raw tunnel (git and friends)
 *
 * Origin-form ("GET /path" plus a Host: header) is also accepted and treated
 * as shape 1, which is what a browser does when it is pointed at Gateway as a
 * plain web server rather than as a proxy.
