/*
 * server.c - Certainly on the other side of the handshake.
 *
 * Gateway patch, for MITM of a CONNECT tunnel. Internet Explorer 4 asked for
 * https://host, and a proxy that answers "200 Connection Established" and then
 * relays bytes leaves IE talking to a 2026 server with a 1997 TLS stack, which
 * fails. So Gateway terminates that TLS itself, with a certificate it minted
 * for the host, and does its own TLS 1.3 to the origin.
 *
 * Much smaller than the client side, because none of what makes that hard
 * applies. There is no TLS 1.3 to negotiate -- the peer is a vintage browser,
 * and br_ssl_server_init_full_rsa already pins BR_TLS10 to BR_TLS12. There is
 * no certificate chain to validate, since we are the one presenting it. There
 * is no name to resolve and no connection to open: the socket arrives already
 * accepted. What is left is the record pump, which is the same shape as the
 * TLS 1.2 half of MacTLS_Pump().
 *
 * The cipher that matters is TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA. BearSSL has no RC4
 * and no single DES, and IE 4 and Netscape 4 have no AES, so 3DES is the whole
 * of the common ground. It is in BearSSL's full RSA server profile already.
 * A browser built for export-grade crypto has no 3DES either and cannot be
 * served at all.
