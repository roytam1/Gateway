# Local patches to Certainly

Certainly is vendored from https://github.com/minorbug/certainly (MIT).
Gateway keeps a copy rather than a submodule because the sources below carry
local fixes. Re-apply them whenever the vendored tree is refreshed.

## 1. `src/tls13_record.c` — ChaCha20-Poly1305 authentication tag was never checked

Upstream `tls13_record_decrypt()` contained:

```c
ok = 1; /* poly1305_run handles verification internally */
```

That comment is wrong. BearSSL's `br_poly1305_*_run()` does not verify
anything on decryption — it *overwrites* the caller's tag buffer with the tag
it computed and leaves the comparison to the caller. As shipped, any forged or
corrupted record on a `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` connection decrypted
"successfully", which defeats the AEAD.

The patch stashes the received tag before the call and compares it against the
computed tag with `tls13_ct_equal()`, a constant-time compare ported from the
equivalent check in `mplsllc/macTLS`. The AES-GCM branch already did the right
thing via `br_gcm_check_tag()`.

## 2. `src/certainly.c` — missing `<Events.h>`

`MacTLS_Pump()` calls `TickCount()` to time out a stalled handshake but never
included `<Events.h>`. Upstream gets away with it because its build installs
Apple's Universal Interfaces over the whole toolchain, and something else in
the include chain happens to declare it. Gateway puts those headers on the
Open Transport translation units only, so the declaration has to be explicit.
Without it GCC 12 fails on `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration`, which is
the default in C99 mode.

## 3. Buffer overflows in the TLS 1.3 record and handshake paths

Three separate writes were driven by a length taken straight off the wire, with
no bound. Any site whose certificate chain or response records were large
enough crashed Gateway with a Mac OS "error of type 2" (address error), or —
when the overflow was small enough to land on the key schedule rather than past
the end of the block — failed the handshake with a bad MAC.

**`tls13_handshake.c`, `tls13_read_encrypted_hs()`.** The one that actually
bit. Every caller passes `hs->msg_buf` as the destination, which was
`unsigned char msg_buf[4096]`, and the function copied a whole handshake
message into it:

```c
hs_body_len = get_u24(hs->plain_buf + hs->plain_offset + 1);
total_hs = 4 + (size_t)hs_body_len;
...
memcpy(out_data, hs->plain_buf + hs->plain_offset, total_hs);
```

`total_hs` is bounded only by the decrypted record, so up to ~16 KB could be
written into 4 KB. A TLS 1.3 Certificate message carrying a leaf plus an
intermediate is routinely 3–6 KB, so this fired on any mainstream CDN. The
overflow ran through `plain_buf`, `read_ctx` and `write_ctx` and then off the
end of the heap block holding `MacTLS_Context`.

Fixed by giving the function an explicit `out_cap`, checking `total_hs` against
it, and sizing `msg_buf` to `TLS13_MAX_PLAINTEXT` — the largest message that
can arrive, since messages spanning several records are already rejected.

**`tls13_record_decrypt()`.** Decryption is in place: the function starts with
`memcpy(dec_buf, ciphertext, ct_len)`. It never checked `ct_len` against the
RFC 8446 §5.2 limit or against the caller's buffer. The two callers passed
buffers of exactly 16384 bytes, while a legal `TLSCiphertext` may be 2^14 + 256
= 16640, so a full-size record overran both by up to 256 bytes. The function
now takes `out_cap` and rejects anything that does not fit, before writing.

**`certainly.c`, `tls13_recv_records()` and `MacTLS_Write()`.** Both declared a
16 KB scratch buffer as a local, several frames deep inside the event loop.
They now use `tls13_dec_buf` and `tls13_enc_buf` in `MacTLS_Context`, sized
against the RFC limits, which fixes the 256-byte shortfall and takes 32 KB off
the Mac OS 9 stack at the same time.

**Hang on an over-long record.** Three loops waited for `recv_len >= 5 +
record_len` before doing anything else. A peer declaring a record longer than
the receive buffer could never satisfy that, so the connection spun forever
instead of failing. Each site now rejects `record_len > TLS13_MAX_CIPHERTEXT`.

`TLS13_MAX_PLAINTEXT` and `TLS13_MAX_CIPHERTEXT` are defined in
`tls13_record.h`, and `tls13_handshake.c` carries compile-time assertions so
the buffer sizes cannot drift back.

## 4. Handshake messages spanning several records were rejected

`tls13_read_encrypted_hs()` decrypted one record at a time and required each
handshake message to be complete within it:

```c
if (total_hs > remaining) {
    /* Handshake message spans multiple records — uncommon but legal. */
    hs->error = BR_ERR_BAD_PARAM;
    return kTLS13_Error;
}
```

It is legal and not especially uncommon: a server is free to fragment the
Certificate message across records, and CDNs with large chains do. The
handshake failed against those hosts with a bad-parameter error.

The buffered plaintext is now reassembled. When what is held is not yet a whole
message — including the case where even the 4-byte header is split — the
partial message is compacted to the front of `plain_buf` and the next record is
decrypted directly behind it. `plain_buf` grew to
`TLS13_MAX_PLAINTEXT + TLS13_MAX_CIPHERTEXT` so it can hold a partial message
plus the whole of the record that completes it.

## 5. No way to start TLS on an existing connection (STARTTLS)

`MacTLS_Create()` opens the socket itself, so there was no way to hand
Certainly a connection that had already carried plaintext. That ruled out
STARTTLS, and with it SMTP submission on port 587 — which is the only port
Microsoft offers for personal Outlook.com accounts.

Added `ot_transport_adopt()` and the public `MacTLS_CreateOnEndpoint()`. The
caller connects the endpoint and speaks the cleartext protocol up to the
server's "ready to start TLS" reply, then transfers the endpoint; the transport
replaces the caller's notifier with its own and starts in the Connected state,
so `MacTLS_Pump()` proceeds straight to the handshake. Ownership transfers
unconditionally, including on failure, so there is no path where both sides
think they should close it.

## 6. Asynchronous DNS held a pointer the caller was free to reuse

`ot_start_dns()` passed the caller's hostname straight to the resolver:

```c
err = OTInetStringToAddress(t->inetSvc, (char *)host, &t->hostInfo);
```

The provider is in asynchronous mode, so this call returns immediately and Open
Transport reads the name later, when the lookup actually runs — it does not
take a copy. The buffer must stay valid and unchanged until
`T_DNRSTRINGTOADDRCOMPLETE` arrives.

Upstream never noticed because its callers pass string literals. Gateway hit it
the moment a hostname came from anywhere else: connections whose host was a
literal or a long-lived struct member worked, while the OAuth token refresh —
whose host comes from the prefs cache, a small rotating set of buffers — got a
name that had been overwritten by the time the resolver looked, and failed with
a bare "connect failed".

`OTTransport` now carries `char host[256]` and resolves that, so the call is
safe whatever the caller does with its own buffer afterwards. Gateway also
keeps its own copies at both call sites, since relying on a library not to
retain a pointer is exactly the assumption that broke here.

## 7. The endpoint was bound after being switched to asynchronous mode

`ot_setup_endpoint()` installed the notifier, called `OTSetAsynchronous()` and
`OTSetNonBlocking()`, and only then called `OTBind()`. On an asynchronous
endpoint `OTBind` returns immediately and reports completion later as
`T_BINDCOMPLETE` — an event the notifier does not handle. Nothing therefore
guaranteed the endpoint was bound by the time `OTConnect()` ran after DNS
resolution, and `OTConnect` on an unbound endpoint fails with
`kOTOutStateErr`. The code worked whenever the DNS lookup happened to take
longer than the bind, which is most of the time and not something to depend on.

The bind now happens first, while the endpoint is still synchronous, so it
blocks until it has actually completed. This is the order Gateway's own
listener and connection code has always used.

## 8. Diagnostics for a connection that fails before the handshake

`MacTLS_GetPhase()` and `MacTLS_GetResolvedAddress()` report how far a
connection got and what the name resolved to. Combined with the existing
`MacTLS_GetOTError()`, a failure can be logged as

    connect failed [connecting TCP, OT -3259, 20.190.173.69]

rather than a bare "connect failed", which separates a name that will not
resolve from an address that will not accept a connection.

## 9. OTConnect was given a stack address it read after the frame was gone

The same class of bug as §6, and the one that actually stopped Gateway from
reaching the OAuth token endpoint. `ot_transport_pump()` built the connect
request in locals:

```c
InetAddress remoteAddr;
TCall       sndCall;

OTInitInetAddress(&remoteAddr, t->port, t->hostInfo.addrs[0]);
sndCall.addr.buf = (unsigned char *)&remoteAddr;
t->lastError = OTConnect(t->endpoint, &sndCall, NULL);
```

The endpoint is asynchronous, so `OTConnect` returns `kOTNoDataErr`
immediately and Open Transport reads the address later, when it actually sends
the SYN. By then `ot_transport_pump()` has returned and that stack frame has
been reused by whatever ran next, so OT connected to whatever happened to be
sitting there. Whether it worked came down to how much stack churn followed the
call, which is why it was survivable on some paths and reliably fatal on
others.

`remoteAddr` and `sndCall` now live in `OTTransport`, next to the hostname
fixed in §6. Both are the same mistake: an asynchronous Open Transport call
does not copy its arguments.

The symptom was a bare `connect failed` with an Open Transport error of 0,
because a SYN to a nonsense address produces `T_DISCONNECT` — see §10.

## 10. T_DISCONNECT was never consumed, and its reason was thrown away

The notifier recorded `t->lastError = result` for `T_DISCONNECT`, but that
argument is always 0 for this event: the reason lives in the `TDiscon` that
`OTRcvDisconnect()` fills in. Every connection refused or reset therefore
reported "no error", which is why the first round of diagnostics came back
empty-handed.

Worse, `OTRcvDisconnect()` is not optional. Until the event is consumed the
endpoint stays in a state where every subsequent call fails with
`kOTLookErr`. `ot_consume_disconnect()` now does both jobs wherever
`disconnectReceived` is handled.

## 11. Only the first resolved address was ever tried

`hostInfo.addrs[0]` was used and the rest ignored, so a single refused or
unreachable address failed the whole connection. Large services rotate through
many: `login.microsoftonline.com` returns eight. `ot_try_next_address()` now
walks the list on `T_DISCONNECT` before giving up.

## 12. Only X25519 was offered for TLS 1.3 key exchange

Certainly generated a single ephemeral key share, on X25519, and rejected any
ServerHello naming a different group. That is fine for most of the web and
fatal for Microsoft:

```
login.microsoftonline.com  -groups X25519  ->  Cipher is (NONE)
login.microsoftonline.com  -groups P-256   ->  TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

`login.microsoftonline.com`, `outlook.office365.com` and
`smtp-mail.outlook.com` all refuse X25519, and Azure drops the connection
rather than answering with a `handshake_failure` alert — so the failure
surfaced as `ECONNRESET` from a TCP connection that had completed, which is
indistinguishable at the transport layer from a connect that never worked.
Every part of Gateway's mail module talks to one of those three hosts, so this
single gap blocked OAuth, IMAP and SMTP alike.

The ClientHello now advertises both X25519 and secp256r1 in
`supported_groups` and carries a key share for **both**, so the server can
finish the exchange from the ClientHello whichever it prefers, with no
HelloRetryRequest round trip. `negotiated_group` records the choice and the
ECDH dispatches on it; the P-256 secret is the X coordinate of the shared
point, per RFC 8446 §7.4.2. BearSSL supplies the curve as `br_ec_p256_m15`.

## 13. Offering TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 guaranteed a failed handshake

The transcript hash has to be started before the server has chosen a cipher
suite, so Certainly starts it as SHA-256. `tls13_state_recv_server_hello()`
then compares the suite's hash against the one already running and gives up if
they differ:

```c
/* TODO: In a full implementation, we'd need to re-hash from the original
 * ClientHello bytes. For now, treat this as an error ... */
hs->error = BR_ERR_BAD_CIPHER_SUITE;
```

`TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` was nevertheless in the offered list, so the failure
was reachable purely by a server taking us up on it — and Microsoft's
endpoints do exactly that, selecting AES-256-GCM-SHA384 whichever order the
client lists suites in:

```
-ciphersuites 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384'  ->  AES_256_GCM_SHA384
-ciphersuites 'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'  ->  AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

So the handshake reached ServerHello and then rejected the server's choice of a
suite Certainly had itself proposed.

The suite is withdrawn from the ClientHello rather than the TODO being
implemented. RFC 8446 §9.1 makes `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` mandatory to
implement, so nothing is lost in interoperability, and the remaining suites all
use SHA-256 — which makes the mismatch branch unreachable instead of merely
unlikely. Restoring AES-256 needs a transcript that keeps the ClientHello bytes
so it can be re-hashed under SHA-384; the HRR path would need the same
treatment for its synthetic message_hash.

## 14. The trust anchor set was too small to reach ordinary sites

Certainly shipped ten roots: Amazon, DigiCert G2/G3, the four Google GTS roots,
both ISRG roots and Starfield. A Mac OS 9 machine has no usable system trust
store and no way to add a root by hand, so that list is the whole of what
Gateway will ever trust — and it does not include GlobalSign, which is what
`lite.cnn.com` chains to:

```
i:OU=GlobalSign ECC Root CA - R5, O=GlobalSign, CN=GlobalSign
```

The handshake reached the certificate and failed verification with
`BR_ERR_X509_NOT_TRUSTED` (62). It looked like the split-record bug from §4
because both surface at the same point in the handshake, but the two are
unrelated: `lite.cnn.com` supports X25519 and every suite offered, and its
chain is a perfectly ordinary 5.8 KB.

`ca_roots.c` is now generated by `tools/generate_ca_roots.py` from a PEM
bundle, emitting the same C that BearSSL's `brssl ta` does, and carries 29
anchors covering the CAs behind the major CDNs, the free-certificate issuers,
and the roots Microsoft and Google chain to. The generator's output was checked
against the previous file: Amazon Root CA 1's DN, modulus and exponent are
byte-for-byte identical, and the EC anchors round-trip.

## 15. Notifiers were left installed on providers being closed

`ot_transport_destroy()` closed both the endpoint and the internet services
provider without removing their notifiers first, then freed the `OTTransport`
they were installed with as their context:

```c
if (t->inetSvc != NULL) OTCloseProvider(t->inetSvc);
if (t->endpoint != NULL) OTCloseProvider(t->endpoint);
DisposePtr((Ptr)t);
```

A transport destroyed while a DNS lookup or a connect is still outstanding can
have `T_DNRSTRINGTOADDRCOMPLETE` or `T_DISCONNECT` delivered to it afterwards.
The notifier then writes its flags into memory that has gone back to the heap,
corrupting the Memory Manager's free list — and the crash lands somewhere
unrelated, some time later. It surfaced as an "error type 3" after pressing a
browser's Stop button, which tears down several in-flight connections at once.

`OTRemoveNotifier()` now precedes every `OTCloseProvider()`. Gateway's own
`GWConn_Destroy()` had the same omission on its DNS provider and is fixed
alongside.

## 16. Closing a connection mid-handshake encrypted with keys that did not exist

`MacTLS_Close()` sent a TLS 1.3 close_notify whenever the state was
`kMacTLS_Connected` **or** `kMacTLS_Handshaking`:

```c
if (ctx->state == kMacTLS_Connected ||
    ctx->state == kMacTLS_Handshaking) {
    if (ctx->tls13_active) {
        ... tls13_record_encrypt(&ctx->hs13.write_ctx, ...)
```

`tls13_active` is set the moment ServerHello selects TLS 1.3, which is well
before the key schedule has produced the write keys. Closing a connection
during its handshake therefore encrypted an alert with a zeroed record
context — `key_len` 0, `cipher_suite` 0. Zero selects the AES-GCM branch, and
`br_aes_ct_ctr_init()` derives its round count from the key length, so a
zero-length key produces a nonsense schedule and the cipher walks off the end
of it. On Mac OS 9 that surfaced as an "error type 3".

Reaching it required nothing unusual: closing the browser, or following a link,
while a page was still loading tears down connections whose handshakes are
still in flight.

The close_notify is now attempted only from `kMacTLS_Connected`, and only when
the write context actually holds a key. `tls13_record_encrypt()` and
`tls13_record_decrypt()` additionally refuse a context with `key_len == 0`
rather than trusting their callers, since the failure mode is memory
corruption rather than a wrong answer.

## §17 — the transport interface, split from Open Transport

*Gateway change, for the Windows port. Not a bug fix.*

`certainly.h` included `<OpenTransport.h>`, so every file that wanted to speak
TLS became a Mac file — including, transitively, Gateway's own portable
transport header. The one thing it needed from it was `EndpointRef`, for the
single `MacTLS_CreateOnEndpoint` parameter.

`ot_transport.h` is now `certainly_transport.h` and names no operating system:
`CTransport` is opaque, `CTSocket` is the platform's own connection handle, and
the eight functions become `ct_transport_*`. `ot_transport.c` becomes
`transport_ot.c`, one implementation of it; `transport_win32.c` is the other.

`certainly.c` read six fields of the transport struct directly —
`ordRelReceived`, `disconnectReceived`, `port`, `lastError`, `state`,
`hostInfo` — which is why the struct could not simply be hidden. Those reads
are now five accessors, one of which (`ct_transport_peer_closed`) replaces the
`ordRelReceived || disconnectReceived` pair that appeared six times. The TLS
core only ever cared that no more bytes were coming, not which of the two ways
the peer had gone.

`ct_socket_close()` exists because `ct_transport_adopt()` takes ownership
unconditionally: a caller that fails before reaching it still has to dispose of
the connection, and `certainly.c` should not have to know that Open Transport
spells that `OTCloseProvider`.

`CERTAINLY_OPEN_TRANSPORT`, set by CMake, selects the implementation and the
`EndpointRef` spelling of `CTSocket`.

## §18 — a TLS record could be sent in part and reported as sent in full

*Found by the Windows port; the bug was always there.*

The TLS 1.3 application-data write path sent the five-byte record header, then
looped over the ciphertext, and broke out of that loop if the transport went
flow controlled — after which it returned the full plaintext length as though
everything had gone. The rest of the record was never sent. The peer received
a truncated record and closed the connection without answering.

Worse, if the *header* send returned zero the function returned 0 and the
caller retried the same plaintext, which encrypted it again — with the next
sequence number. A number the peer never saw had been consumed, so even a
small request could kill the connection.

On Mac OS 9 neither half was reachable in practice: `OTSnd` on a non-blocking
endpoint either takes the whole buffer or returns `kOTFlowErr` having sent
nothing, so partial sends did not occur and a zero-length header send was rare
enough never to be hit. Winsock's `send()` returns a partial count as a matter
of course once the socket buffer fills. The first thing the Windows build did
was fail to refresh an OAuth token, and the Wayback proxy reported the same
thing as `upstream closed before sending a response`.

The record is now staged whole — header and ciphertext in one buffer, which is
why `tls13_enc_buf` grew by five bytes — and `MacTLS_Write` refuses to encrypt
another until the last one has left entirely, so a sequence number is never
consumed twice. `MacTLS_Pump` drains what is still owed, because the ordinary
shape of an exchange is a caller that writes a whole request and then only
reads.

## §19 — HKDF-Expand-Label wrote past the end of every key and IV buffer

*Found by the Windows port. A stack buffer overflow, present on Mac OS 9 too.*

`hkdf_expand_label()` finished with

```c
br_hmac_out(&mc, out);
```

and `br_hmac_out()` always writes the hash function's entire output — 32 bytes
for SHA-256. `out_len` is routinely smaller than that: a TLS 1.3 IV is 12
bytes, and an AES-128 key is 16. So every IV derivation wrote **20 bytes past
the end of the caller's buffer**, and every AES-128 key derivation wrote 16
past. In `tls13_state_recv_finished` the destination buffers are adjacent
locals:

```c
unsigned char client_key[32], client_iv[12];
unsigned char server_key[32], server_iv[12];
```

so the overflow landed on whichever local the compiler had placed next — and
which key it destroyed was therefore a property of the stack layout, not of the
source. That is why the same code was correct on PowerPC, corrupted the
*client* application traffic key on x86 at `-Os`, and corrupted the *server's*
at `-O0`. The handshake keys survived in every layout, which is what made this
so hard to see: the handshake completed, the Finished was accepted, and only
the first application record failed.

The comment left at that call said the caller "gets the first out_len bytes",
which describes what was intended rather than what the code did.

It now expands into a full-sized block and copies out only what was asked for.

Getting here took a known-answer test proving the cipher itself was correct in
both directions, byte counters proving the request reached the wire, key
fingerprints proving the stash was intact, and finally the peer's own alert —
`bad_record_mac` — which the library had been discarding (§18 area, fixed in
the same session). Each of those eliminated a layer that had otherwise been
guessed at.

## §20 — decrypted application data was discarded when the reader was behind

*Found by the Windows port's log reaching Mac OS 9. A data-loss bug on both.*

`tls13_recv_records()` appended each decrypted record to `tls13_app_buf` like
this:

```c
/* Append decrypted data (truncate if buffer full) */
size_t space = sizeof(ctx->tls13_app_buf) - ctx->tls13_app_len;
size_t copy = (dec_len < space) ? dec_len : space;
```

`tls13_app_buf` holds exactly one maximum-sized record. Whenever the
application read more slowly than the peer sent — which, on a 1999 Macintosh
behind a browser fetching a dozen resources, is the ordinary case — unread
bytes were still in the buffer when the next full record arrived, and the
overflow was thrown away without a word.

The result is a hole punched into the middle of the byte stream. A
Content-Length body arrives short and the session sits until its idle timeout.
A chunked body loses sync with its own framing a few kilobytes later, and the
proxy reports `malformed chunked body` — which is what led here, since the
chunked decoder was the obvious suspect and turned out to be innocent: the
exact failing response, captured from the live server, replayed through it
cleanly at every slice size and every drain rate.

The record is now left in `tls13_recv_buf` until there is room for its
plaintext. That costs nothing — the bytes are already buffered, and the next
pump finds them again once the reader has drained. The append can no longer
overflow, and a short copy is treated as an error rather than silently
tolerated.

This also explains the pauses: a body that never completes holds its session
until the 45-second idle timeout, and a page whose resources each do that loads
at the speed of the timeout rather than the network.

### §20 correction — the room test refused every full-sized record

The check added above compared the *ciphertext* length against the plaintext
buffer. A maximum-sized TLS 1.3 record is 16384 bytes of plaintext and
therefore 16401 on the wire — a content type byte and a 16-byte tag on top —
while `tls13_app_buf` holds exactly 16384. So `16384 - 0 < 16401` was true even
with a completely empty buffer, the record was never decrypted, and the
connection sat until its idle timeout.

It reached anything large enough to fill one record. A 24 KB image from the
Internet Archive does: nginx sends one maximum-sized record and one small one,
and the first could never be accepted.

The test now subtracts the overhead, so an empty buffer always has room for a
legal record. A record claiming more plaintext than the buffer can ever hold is
treated as an error rather than waited on, since no amount of draining would
make space for it.

## §21 — the CryptoAPI import kept the binary off Windows 95 RTM and NT 3.51

*Gateway change, for older Windows than the port first aimed at. Not a bug fix
on any system that already ran.*

Reported as [brunocastello/Gateway#1](https://github.com/brunocastello/Gateway/issues/1)
by roytam1, who had solved the same problem in RetroZilla.

`entropy_win32.c` called `CryptAcquireContextA`, `CryptGenRandom` and
`CryptReleaseContext` directly, and handled failure carefully — a machine whose
default key container had never been created simply lost that one source. What
it could not handle is the case where the functions are not there at all.
CryptoAPI arrived with Windows 95 OSR2 and NT 4.0; on 95 RTM, 95 OSR1 and NT
3.51 the ADVAPI32 that ships with the system exports none of it. Naming those
functions in C puts them in the PE import table, and the loader resolves every
import before the first instruction of the program runs. The result is not one
missing entropy source, it is a dialog about a missing entry point and a
process that never starts. No amount of in-function checking can reach that.

The three names are now looked up with `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress`, and
the source is skipped when any of them is absent. `<wincrypt.h>` is gone with
them and the handful of types and constants are declared locally, so that a
later edit cannot restore the import by reaching for the obvious spelling.
`SystemFunction036` — `RtlGenRandom` — is tried first, since on XP it is the
same generator without the key-container question; nothing older exports it,
which makes the lookup its own version test.

BearSSL carried a second copy of the same import. `src/inner.h` turns on
`BR_USE_WIN32_RAND` for any `_WIN32` target, which compiles the CryptoAPI
seeder in `src/rand/sysrng.c`. Gateway never used it — `certainly.c` injects
our own pool into every engine before the handshake, which sets
`rng_init_done` to 2 and stops `br_ssl_engine_init_rand` consulting
`br_prng_seeder_system` at all. It is now switched off explicitly in
`Makefile.win32`. The Mac OS 9 build has always run with no seeder compiled in,
so this is not a new configuration, only a newly deliberate one.

### What is left when there is no system PRNG

The pool, which on those systems is the whole story: `QueryPerformanceCounter`,
`GetTickCount`, a FILETIME, cursor position, process and thread IDs and
`GlobalMemoryStatus`, hashed to 32 bytes per handshake. `add_machine()` now
adds the cheap machine-specific sources NSS gathers for the same reason —
volume serial, filesystem and volume names, free and total clusters, computer
name, logical drive bitmap. None of it changes between two runs, so it does
nothing for the difference between one handshake and the next; what it does is
separate this machine from an identical one installed off the same disk.

NSS goes considerably further on this path, walking the temp directory and
shell folders and reading up to 250 KB of file contents into the pool. That is
the right call for a library that cannot yield, and the wrong one here: on a
95-era disk it would stall the cooperative loop for seconds at startup.

Which of the three states a machine is in is now reported through
`MacTLS_EntropySource()` and logged once at startup, so a screenshot of the log
answers the question rather than the Windows version being used to guess at it.
On Mac OS the function returns NULL and nothing is logged — there has never
been a system generator to fall back from, so there is no second state to
distinguish.

### Not fixed here

This does not by itself reach Windows 95 RTM. MinGW-w64 links `msvcrt.dll`,
which only ships with the operating system from 95 OSR2 onward; before that the
system runtime is `crtdll.dll`. That is the real floor, and the installer now
carries a copy for machines that lack one.

NT 3.51 needed a third thing, outside Certainly: its `Shell_NotifyIcon` is an
exported stub that fails with `ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, so Gateway would
have run with no icon, no menu and no way to reach it. `main_win32.c` now looks
that function up rather than importing it, checks what `NIM_ADD` returns, and
falls back to a menu bar on the log window. The lesson of this patch generalised
further than the patch did.

None of it has been run on either system. The imports are checked on every
build; the behaviour is not, and cannot be from here.

## §22 — BearSSL accepts the SSLv2-compatible ClientHello framing

*BearSSL patch, in `bearssl/src/ssl/ssl_engine.c`, `bearssl/inc/bearssl_ssl.h`
and `bearssl/src/ssl/ssl_hs_server.c`. The first BearSSL files Gateway
modifies; everything above is Certainly. Contributed by roytam1 as
`roytam1/Gateway@65f2c9f`, taken with its second change dropped — see the end
of this section.*

A vintage browser with "Use SSL 2.0" checked wraps an otherwise TLS-capable
CLIENT-HELLO in the 2-byte SSLv2 record header (high bit set) instead of the
TLS 5-byte header. BearSSL rejected that before any field was read, in
`recvrec_ack()`:

```c
/* Note: right now, we reject clients that try to send
 * a ClientHello in a format compatible with SSL-2.0. ... */
```

so a browser that could have negotiated TLS 1.0 failed with
`BR_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` (3) over framing alone.

The engine now detects a high-bit first byte on the very first record (only
then: `version_in` must still be 0 and encryption inactive, otherwise
`BR_ERR_UNEXPECTED`), gathers the whole SSLv2 message — up to `SSL2_MAX_MSG`
(2048) bytes, past which `BR_ERR_TOO_LARGE` — and rewrites it in place to a
plain TLS ClientHello record:

* `CLIENT-HELLO` (msg type 1) only; anything else is `BR_ERR_UNEXPECTED`.
  A version below 3.0 is still `BR_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`: pure SSLv2 and
  its crypto are not implemented and never will be.
* TLS suites arrive as `0x00 xx xx` and are kept; the SSLv2 3DES spec
  `0x07 0x00 0xC0` maps to `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA` (`0x00 0x0A`),
  the only suite these browsers share with BearSSL. Other SSLv2-specific
  specs (RC4, single DES) are dropped, and an empty remainder is
  `BR_ERR_BAD_CIPHER_SUITE`. The challenge (required 16–32 bytes) becomes
  `client_random`, left-padded with zeros per RFC 6101 Appendix E. A session
  id over 32 bytes is `BR_ERR_OVERSIZED_ID`; one of a legal length is
  dropped rather than echoed, because RFC 5246 Appendix E.2 requires the
  field empty in a converted hello — a V2 session id can only name an
  SSLv2 session, which is not resumable here.
* The rewritten hello carries no extensions — SSLv2 has none — so there is
  no SNI or secure-renegotiation signalling; the handshake already handles
  their absence with defaults. Gateway does not need SNI: the leaf is minted
  from the host in the `CONNECT` line, not from the hello.

`record_type_in = 0x80` (`SSL2_MARKER`, never a real TLS content type) marks
a message being gathered. Split delivery works: the marker is set once the
5-byte read completes and conversion runs when the remainder arrives.

### The transcript hash

The Finished messages cover every handshake byte, and the client hashes the
hello it *sent*, not the one we rewrote. RFC 5246 Appendix E.2 excludes only
the V2 length header, so the conversion feeds `msg_type` onward straight into
the multihasher and sets `hash_skip` (new field, `bearssl_ssl.h`) to the
length of the re-encoded message. The two read paths in `ssl_hs_server.c`
count that down instead of hashing, so the rewritten bytes are never hashed
twice. Without this both sides compute different verify data and every
handshake fails at the last message.

The pre-feed is safe because the multihasher is pristine at that point:
`ssl_hs_server.t0` runs `multihash-init` inside `do-handshake` immediately
before `read-ClientHello`, and the V2 framing is only accepted when
`version_in` is still 0, so a converted hello is always the first thing in
the transcript.

`ssl_hs_server.c` is generated from `ssl_hs_server.t0` by the T0 compiler,
which Gateway does not run. The two hash gates live in the generated file
only; regenerating it drops them, and the Finished failure that follows will
not look like a missing patch. A comment at the top of the file says so.

### Not taken

The original commit carried a second, undocumented change in
`jump_handshake()`: a ClientHello whose body version was `0x0300` had the
byte rewritten to `0x0301` so BearSSL's `version_min` would accept it. That
is left out. It rewrites the byte before the handshake code hashes it, and
`hash_skip` does not cover that path, so an ordinary SSL 3.0 hello would
break its own Finished; the guard is three bytes of pattern against a buffer
that is frequently positioned mid-message, so it can fire by chance; and a
client that offered `0x0300` as its maximum is entitled to reject the
`0x0301` ServerHello it would get back. A browser that can do TLS 1.0 puts
`0x0301` in the body; one that cannot is asking for SSL 3.0, which BearSSL
does not implement. §23 names the offered version in the log instead.

### Verification

Not verified here. roytam1 reports testing the conversion on the host with
mingw-gcc against the vendored tree: an IE-style hello (version `0x0301`,
ciphers `0700C0`/`00000A`/`010080`, 16-byte challenge) fed byte-at-a-time
converts to record type 22 with the padded random and the two 3DES suites; a
normal TLS header is still accepted; a `0x0002` version still fails
`UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`; a second SSLv2 header fails `UNEXPECTED`. What remains
untested on both sides is the part that only a real browser can exercise: a
complete handshake through a converted hello, Finished included.

## §23 — the TLS 1.2 fallback could not revive a failed engine

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c`.*

Certainly attempts TLS 1.3 with its own state machine and falls back to
BearSSL's T0 engine when the server will not do 1.3 — by closing the
connection, reconnecting, and calling `br_ssl_client_reset()`. That reset is
not enough on its own, and the fallback discarded what it returned.

`br_ssl_engine_fail()` sets two things:

```c
if (rc->iomode != BR_IO_FAILED) {
        rc->iomode = BR_IO_FAILED;
        rc->err = err;
}
```

`br_ssl_client_reset()` calls `br_ssl_engine_hs_reset()`, which clears the
handshake state, the T0 stacks, `alert` and `shutdown_recv` — and neither
`iomode` nor `err`. It then ends with

```c
return br_ssl_engine_last_error(&cc->eng) == BR_ERR_OK;
```

so against an engine that has ever failed it returns 0 and leaves it failed.
The only entry point that puts `iomode` back to `BR_IO_INOUT` and `err` back
to `BR_ERR_OK` is `br_ssl_engine_set_buffers_bidi()`, reached through
`br_ssl_engine_set_buffer()`. The fallback never called it, so a client
context that failed once reported the same stale number for the rest of its
life, and the caller — which ignored the return — went on driving it.

The fallback now re-arms the buffer before resetting the client and treats a
failed reset as fatal rather than looping on a context that can no longer
handshake. Suites, versions, trust anchors and the seeded RNG all survive
`set_buffer`; only the record state is reset, which is exactly what a
reconnect wants.

### Telling the two handshakes apart

`MacTLS_GetBearSSLError()` reports whichever leg failed, and both use
`BR_ERR_*` numbering, so `TLS 1` in the log could be the 1.3 parser rejecting
a ServerHello field or the 1.2 engine refusing to start — opposite faults with
the same number. `MacTLS_GetTls13Error()` now says which, and `gw_stream.c`
puts it in the line: `TLS 1 1.3` against `TLS 1 1.2`.

### What this does and does not explain

It was found looking for why `www.floodgap.com` fails. That host has no TLS
1.3 at all — a 1.3 ClientHello draws a `handshake_failure` alert — so it
always takes this path, where almost nothing else goes, and the log shows four
identical reconnects each ending in `TLS 1`. A sticky error reproduces exactly
like that, where a genuine protocol failure would tend to vary.

That is a motive, not a proof. Nothing here establishes that `err` was
actually non-zero at the moment of the fallback; the engine's handshake is
deliberately never started before then (`certainly.c`, the note above
`MacTLS_Create`), so it should be pristine. The defect is real and worth
fixing on its own terms either way, and the new log marker is what will
identify the leg next time rather than leaving it to inference.

---

## §24 — a failed ServerHello could not say which field it disliked

*Certainly patch, in `src/tls13_handshake.c`.*

The TLS 1.3 ServerHello path had seventeen separate ways to answer
`BR_ERR_BAD_PARAM`. All of them arrive in the log as `TLS 1`, and none of them
says which field was wrong or even which check ran. Diagnosing one cost three
rounds of inference about a server nobody here can packet-capture.

Those sites now answer `0x3000 | __LINE__`. Subtract `0x3000` from the number
in the log and the remainder is the line in `tls13_handshake.c` — for the
build the log came from, which the `GW_BUILD_ID` stamp identifies, since the
line numbers move whenever the file does. The rest of the file still answers
`BR_ERR_BAD_PARAM`; only the path that has needed finding was changed.

`gw_stream.c` prints any code at or above `0x1000` in hex, so the encoded
families read straight off: `0x1LLDD` is an alert the peer sent, `0x2000|type`
a record that was not one, `0x3000|line` a rejected field. Plain `BR_ERR_*`
numbers stay decimal, which is how they are quoted everywhere else.

### The ordering fault behind it

The record header was read in the wrong order:

```c
record_type = recv_buf[0];
record_len = get_u16(recv_buf + 3);

if (record_len > TLS13_MAX_CIPHERTEXT) {   /* ran first */
        ...BAD_PARAM
}
...
if (record_type != TLS13_CT_HANDSHAKE) {   /* could not be reached */
        hs->error = 0x2000 | (int)record_type;
}
```

The length only means anything once the first byte says this is a TLS record
at all. A server answering 443 with plain text sends `HTTP/`, whose bytes 3
and 4 read as a 20527-byte record, so the length check rejected it as a bad
parameter without ever looking at the byte that would have explained it — and
the unexpected-type branch below was unreachable for any type whose header
happened to encode an absurd length, which is most of them. The type is now
validated first.

### Not a fix for anything yet

This diagnoses; it does not repair. It was written because
`www.floodgap.com` fails with `TLS 1 1.3` — the 1.3 state machine, not the
1.2 engine that §23 addressed — and none of the seventeen sites could be
ruled in or out from here. The next log from that host names the line.

---

## §25 — a TLS 1.2 ServerHello with no extensions was rejected as malformed

*Certainly patch, in `src/tls13_handshake.c`. This is the one that makes
`www.floodgap.com` reachable.*

`tls13_parse_server_hello()` opened with

```c
/*
 * Minimum ServerHello size:
 * 4 (hs header) + 2 (version) + 32 (random) + 1 (session_id_len) +
 * 2 (cipher suite) + 1 (compression) + 2 (extensions length) = 44
 */
if (msg_len < 44) {
```

The extensions length is not mandatory. RFC 5246 7.4.1.3 makes the whole
extensions block optional in a TLS 1.2 ServerHello — its presence is detected
by whether any bytes follow `compression_method` — so a server with no
extensions to send stops after 42 bytes. TLS 1.3 does require extensions, but
a 1.3 server is not who sends a short hello; recognising a 1.2 one and handing
over to BearSSL is the entire reason this function parses a hello it cannot
use.

Forty lines further down the function already knew that:

```c
if (pos + 2 > msg_len) {
        /* No extensions at all — this is a TLS 1.2 ServerHello */
        return kTLS13_Fallback12;
}
```

which was unreachable for exactly the servers it was written for. The minimum
is now 42. Every field between is bounds-checked individually, so nothing else
had to change: a 42-byte hello walks version, random, an empty session id,
the suite and the compression byte, finds no extensions, and falls back.

### Why floodgap and almost nothing else

`www.floodgap.com` runs HTTPi on AIX and has no TLS 1.3 at all — a 1.3
ClientHello draws a `handshake_failure` — so it always takes the fallback
path, where almost nothing else goes. The size then comes down to what
Certainly asks for. Against OpenSSL's ClientHello the same server answers with
57 bytes, because OpenSSL offers `ec_point_formats` and `renegotiation_info`
and it echoes both:

```
02 00 00 35 03 03 <32-byte random> 00 c0 2f 00
00 0d ff 01 00 01 00 00 0b 00 04 03 00 01 02
```

That is 42 bytes of hello, a 2-byte extensions length and 13 bytes of
extensions. Certainly's ClientHello offers neither extension, so the server
has nothing to put in the block and omits it: 57 − 15 = 42, one byte under the
gate. A server that echoes anything at all clears 44 and was never affected,
which is why this survived every other host.

### How it was found

Not by reading. `TLS 1` in the log was one of seventeen `BR_ERR_BAD_PARAM`
sites and three rounds of inference had not narrowed it. §24 made those sites
answer `0x3000 | __LINE__`; the next log said `TLS 0x3319 1.3`, and
`0x319` is line 793. The line-numbered codes stay, because the next one of
these should cost one build rather than four.

---

## §26 — a connected TLS 1.2 session was put back into handshaking by its own writes

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c`. With §25, this is what makes a
TLS 1.2-only origin work at all.*

The pump classified the engine's state after every cycle:

```c
if (st & (BR_SSL_SENDAPP | BR_SSL_RECVAPP)) {
        ctx->state = kMacTLS_Connected;
} else if (st & (BR_SSL_SENDREC | BR_SSL_RECVREC)) {
        /* Only record-level I/O — still handshaking */
        ctx->state = kMacTLS_Handshaking;
}
```

The engine runs on one buffer for both directions —
`br_ssl_engine_set_buffer(&ctx->sc.eng, ctx->iobuf, sizeof(ctx->iobuf), 0)`,
where the trailing 0 is `bidi` — so it works one direction at a time. While an
outgoing record is being pushed out, the engine offers neither `SENDAPP` nor
`RECVAPP` and `br_ssl_engine_current_state()` is `BR_SSL_SENDREC` alone.

That is not a handshake in progress. It is the ordinary condition of a
connected session that has just been written to, which is every session in the
instant after its request goes out. The context went backwards to
`kMacTLS_Handshaking`, and

```c
if (ctx->state != kMacTLS_Connected &&
    ctx->state != kMacTLS_Closing &&
    ctx->state != kMacTLS_Closed) return -1;
```

at the top of `MacTLS_Read()` then answered -1 — a read failure reported on a
connection in perfect health, with no error set anywhere in it. Once
`Connected`, only `BR_SSL_CLOSED` leaves it now.

### What it looked like

```
#8 www.floodgap.com read failed: ok [connected, OT 0, TLS 0, 76.79.210.35]
```

Every part of that line is a consequence. `read failed` is the -1. `ok` is
`GWStream_ErrorText`, because nothing had failed. `TLS 0` is the engine's
error, because there was not one. And the version is missing because
`MacTLS_GetVersion()` also answers only in `Connected` — the same backwards
state, showing up twice in one line and saying so in neither.

### Why nothing caught it sooner

Nothing had ever reached the TLS 1.2 path. Certainly always opens with a TLS
1.3 ClientHello, and §25 was rejecting the ServerHello of every server that
answered it in 1.2, so the fallback ended in an error before any application
data was read. §25 made the path reachable and this was the next thing in it.
Both are needed and neither is sufficient: a TLS 1.2-only origin could not be
fetched from before today.

Most of the web hides this, since a host with TLS 1.3 never goes near either
bug. `www.floodgap.com` is a small hand-written server on AIX with no 1.3 at
all, which is why it was the site that found both.

---

## §27 — the tail of every MITM'd response was discarded at close

*Certainly patch, in `src/server.c`, with the matching change in
`src/proxy/gw_httpproxy.c`. This is why images did not appear on a page
fetched over `https` with `connect_mitm`.*

`MacTLS_ServerWrite()` stages plaintext in the engine and flushes it into a
record. The record reaches the socket in `MacTLS_ServerPump()`, which is a
separate call. `MacTLS_ServerClose()` never pumped:

```c
if (s->state == kMacTLS_Connected || s->state == kMacTLS_Handshaking)
        br_ssl_engine_close(&s->sc.eng);

if (s->transport != NULL) {
        ct_transport_close(s->transport);
        ct_transport_destroy(s->transport);
```

and the proxy closed the moment the last byte had been *written*:

```c
int r = session_flush(s);
if (r != 0) s->state = kHPDone;      /* -> GWStream_Close(&s->cli) */
```

So whatever had not yet been pumped was thrown away with the transport. On a
plaintext hop this is invisible, because the bytes are in the socket by the
time the write returns and the operating system flushes on close. On a TLS hop
they are in a buffer Gateway owns.

`GWStream_SendPending()` now answers whether the engine still holds records,
and `kHPFlushAndClose` waits for it. It cannot hang: pending output counts as
waiting on the client in the idle check, so a browser that stops reading ends
the session on the ordinary timeout.

### Why it looked like an image problem

Size decided it. A small body fits one write, so the whole response was staged
and then discarded — nothing arrived. A large one crosses many
`session_step()` passes, each of which pumps, so all but the last records were
already gone. Google's page is chunked and long and rendered; its logo is 2478
bytes and did not.

The same page over plain `http` was whole, because Google serves its
subresources under the scheme of the document: from an `http://` page the
images are fetched over `http` and never touch this path at all. That is what
made it look like a difference between two schemes rather than between two
transports, and it is why the upstream side was searched first — the logs show
every resource fetched identically in both cases, which was true and was not
the question.

### Also here

`MacTLS_ServerPump()` carried the same state fault as §26 — record-level I/O
alone read as "still handshaking" — and it is fixed the same way. It was
latent: `MacTLS_ServerRead()` and `MacTLS_ServerWrite()` consult the engine
directly rather than `s->state`, and `GWStream_Pump()` will not move a stream
back out of Ready, so nothing acted on it. Left in place it would have been
waiting for the first caller that did.

## §28 — the TLS 1.2 fallback reconnected an adopted connection to port 0

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c` (`MacTLS_FallbackNoRoute()`), with the
matching log lines in `src/proxy/gw_tunnel.c` and `src/proxy/gw_mail.c`.*

The fallback reconnects: it closes the transport, dials the same host and
port again, and runs BearSSL's 1.2 engine over the fresh connection. That is
only possible for a transport Certainly opened itself. An adopted one — a
tunnel through an HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS proxy, or a STARTTLS upgrade — has no
route to redial: `ct_transport_adopt()` stores no host or port, so the port
read 0, and even with them a fresh dial would bypass the proxy or the
cleartext prologue the server is waiting on.

What this used to do was dial that port 0 directly. The proxy tunnel was torn
down first, so the far end logged "peer suddenly disconnected" while Gateway
reported an empty-handed handshake failure — no BearSSL code, no transport
error, no resolved address — which reads as a proxy problem although the
proxy had already done its part. The actual event is a version problem: the
server chose TLS 1.2.

An adopted transport now fails with the original connection intact and raises
`MacTLS_FallbackNoRoute()`, and the tunnel and mail modules log the remedy
beside the failure: the far end needs TLS 1.3 enabled. Falling back across a
proxy or STARTTLS would mean re-running the proxy handshake or the prologue
from inside the library, which does not know either, so that stays
unimplemented rather than silently wrong.

## §29 — adopted connections can start in TLS 1.2 for far ends without 1.3

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c` (`MacTLS_CreateOnEndpointTLS12()`),
with `GWStream_UpgradeToTLS12()` and the `tunnel_tls12` pref on top.*

§28 named the remedy as "enable TLS 1.3 on the far end", and the first far
end to hit it cannot: an old stunnel built against a pre-1.3 OpenSSL. For an
adopted connection the 1.3 ClientHello buys nothing there — only the fallback
that cannot run — so the library now offers to skip it:
`MacTLS_CreateOnEndpointTLS12()` adopts the socket like `CreateOnEndpoint`,
resets BearSSL's 1.2 engine onto it (hostname for SNI, as the fallback does),
and sets `force_tls12`, which keeps both 1.3 branches of `MacTLS_Pump()` from
ever starting. Everything below — record I/O, version reporting, close — is
the same engine path the fallback already uses, so `GetVersion()` reports 12
on success with no further special cases.

The tunnel selects it with `tunnel_tls12 = 1` in
`begin_tls_or_splice()`; the default path is untouched.

## §30 — a trust-any validator for testing against unvalidatable far ends

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c` (`MacTLS_SetInsecure()`), exposed as
`GWStream_SetInsecure()` and the `tunnel_insecure` pref.*

The first far end past the new tunnel failed validation rather than the
handshake: a publicly trusted chain for another name (`TLS 56`), on a host
whose certificate cannot be fixed from here. The library had no way to say
"encrypt without authenticating" — `MacTLS_ConfigAddCA` is still a stub, so
not even a private CA can be installed — which left testing fully blocked
behind a correct rejection.

`MacTLS_SetInsecure()` swaps both validation paths (BearSSL's 1.2 engine and
the 1.3 state machine's shared `x509_ctx`) onto a trust-any engine that
decodes only the end-entity certificate, for its public key, and accepts
everything else without checking. It is modelled on BearSSL's own knownkey
engine, except the key comes out of the peer's certificate through the
decoder instead of being configured in advance; an undecodable certificate
fails the chain with the decoder's own error, so the engine reports a
handshake failure rather than dereferencing a NULL key. Both key usages are
reported permitted, as in BearSSL's test tool.

Deliberately narrow: the setter must run before the first Pump, the tunnel
logs a WARNING naming the pref every time it takes effect, and the mail
module has no path to it whatever the prefs say.

## §31 — the SNI name is overridable for SNI-policing middleboxes

*Certainly patch (`MacTLS_SetSNI()`), exposed as `GWStream_SetSNI()` and the
`tunnel_sni` pref.*

Through one corporate proxy (BlueCoat-style, `Via: 1.1 wcg`), a handshake
carrying no SNI completed while an otherwise identical one carrying the far
hostname stalled past the 30-second timeout: the CONNECT was accepted in
both cases, and socat's nameless 1.2 ClientHello flowed where Gateway's
SNI-bearing one did not. Nothing in the failure says so -- it reads as the
same empty-handed handshake failure as §28.

`MacTLS_SetSNI()` replaces the name BearSSL sends and validates against
(NULL omits SNI; BearSSL accepts that) and the name the 1.3 state machine
offers, through one `eff_sni()` helper used by the creation reset, the
fallback reset, and the 1.3 pump. It must run before the first Pump, like
`SetInsecure`, and re-resets the idle engine the same way the other call
sites do. The 1.3 ClientHello builder treats a NULL name as "omit the SNI
extension" rather than dereferencing it -- the one `strlen(hostname)` in
that file assumed a name always exists, which an omitted SNI disproves on
the first handshake. `MacTLS_SetSNI()` re-stamps the §32 compat version
after its own reset, which would otherwise undo it. The tunnel logs which
SNI it sends; the default (pref unset) is unchanged.

## §32 — the 1.2 ClientHello record went out as 03 03 instead of 03 01

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c` (`client_first_record_compat()`).*

`br_ssl_client_reset()` stamps `version_min` into `version_out`, and the
1.2-only pin in `setup_bearssl()` makes that 0x0303 -- so BearSSL's
ClientHello record reads `16 03 03` where OpenSSL, browsers, and
Certainly's own 1.3 stack all send `16 03 01`. A version-intolerant
middlebox that only forwards 03 01 first records drops it silently: same
destination, 200 from the proxy, then 30 seconds of nothing, while an
OpenSSL hello through the same tunnel flows. The direct path never showed
it because servers accept either.

**Why the stamp has to ride inside the reset.** The first version of this
patch set `version_out` *after* `br_ssl_client_reset()` returned, and the
tap kept showing `03 03`. It had to: `br_ssl_client_reset()` does not just
reset state, it runs `jump_handshake()` (`ssl_engine.c:1556`) before
returning, and that processor "never leaves an unfinished outgoing record"
-- so the ClientHello is assembled and `flush-record()` bakes its 5-byte
header through `sendpld_flush()` using `version_out` at that instant
(`ssl_engine.c:1088`). By the time the post-reset stamp ran, the header
bytes were already fixed in `obuf`. Setting a field the header has already
copied is a no-op on the wire.

So `client_first_record_compat()` is now the reset itself: it drops
`version_min` to `BR_TLS10` across the `br_ssl_client_reset()` call, then
restores it to `BR_TLS12`. `version_min` is the only lever the header
reads while the reset runs (`ssl_client.c:48`). Its sole other client-side
consumer is the `read-ServerHello` range check
(`ssl_hs_client.t0:656`), which runs long after this returns, so the
1.2-only pin ends up exactly as strict as it was -- a ServerHello asking
for 0x0301 or 0x0302 still fails. `version_max` is never touched: it
supplies the ClientHello's `legacy_version` (`ssl_hs_client.t0:462`) and
the ServerHello upper bound, both staying 0x0303.

`read-ServerHello` overwrites `version_out` with the negotiated version,
so only the pre-negotiation flight is affected and everything after
ServerHello is byte-identical to before. Unconditional -- 03 01 first is
the ecosystem convention, not a workaround, so every connection gets it,
not just tunnels.

---

## §33 — a peer that hung up mid-handshake waited out the 30-second timeout

*Certainly patch, in `src/certainly.c` (`MacTLS_Pump()`,
`tls13_pump_handshake()`, `MacTLS_GetVersion()`), `src/server.c`
(`MacTLS_ServerPump()`) and `src/transport_win32.c` (`ct_transport_adopt()`,
`ct_transport_send()`).*

`ct_transport_recv()` reports an orderly EOF as `0` with `peerClosed` set
(`transport_win32.c:311`), and the header comment says so explicitly: *"The
peer closed its side. The interface reports that through
`ct_transport_peer_closed()`, not through this return value."* A `WSAECONNRESET`
lands the same way. Both close tests were written against the other
convention -- `if (n < 0) { if (ct_transport_peer_closed(...)) closed; }` --
so EOF, which is never negative, fell through both of them, `handshake_step`
kept answering `WantRead`, and nothing observed the FIN at all.

What the caller saw was therefore the timeout, not the close:

```c
if (ctx->state == kMacTLS_Handshaking) {
    if ((uint32_t)TickCount() - ctx->handshake_start_ticks > 30 * 60) {
        ctx->state = kMacTLS_Error;
        ctx->error = kMacTLS_ErrHandshake;
```

`br_ssl_engine_last_error()` is still 0 -- the engine never failed, it was
waiting -- so `MacTLS_GetBearSSLError()` returns 0 and `GWStream_Describe()`
produces `TLS handshake failed [connected, OT 0, TLS 0, name unresolved]`.
Every word of that is wrong in a different direction. `connected` comes from
`MacTLS_GetPhase()`, which reads the *transport* state, and a transport that
has received a FIN is still `kCTransport_Connected` -- `peerClosed` is a
separate flag. `OT 0` and `TLS 0` are both true: there is genuinely no error
anywhere, only a peer nobody asked. And `name unresolved` is `t->addr`, which
`ct_transport_adopt()` never fills in, because an adopted socket skipped the
resolve step that would have set it.

The fix moves the close test out of the `n < 0` arm in both handshake paths,
so it runs on `n == 0` too. The TLS 1.3 path already had the right rule
written down -- drain `tls13_recv_buf` before declaring the close, since
partial data can be sitting in it -- it was simply unreachable, because the
only way in was a negative return. On the BearSSL path the engine's own
buffer holds at most an incomplete record the peer will never finish, so
closing there loses nothing. `MacTLS_GetVersion()` also stops answering only
in `Connected`: `session.version` is set the instant a ServerHello arrives,
and a peer that sends one and then hangs up now reports the version it chose
rather than "without answering the ClientHello".

Two supporting changes. `ct_transport_send()` sets `peerClosed` on
`WSAECONNRESET`/`WSAECONNABORTED`, so the send arm's existing close test can
fire before a recv has ever run. `ct_transport_adopt()` calls `getpeername()`
so an adopted connection names its peer instead of reporting that nothing
resolved it.

The same silence was seen from a TLS 1.2-only far end holding a TLS 1.3
ClientHello, and the two were indistinguishable in the log for the same
reason -- nothing had arrived to distinguish them. This is what made that
case readable: the tap shows zero bytes back, and now so does the log,
immediately, instead of 30 seconds later under an error name.
